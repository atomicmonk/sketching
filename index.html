		<div class="testimonials">
			<p>“I highly recommend it for developers and product builders...I created a good enough design myself, without much time or money, and was able to launch my product. —Eric Davis, @edavis10</p>

			<p>“Design is often described as something mysterious, that can only be accomplished by the talented few. That's bullshit. Design is a skill that can be learned. It's also a process that can be reverse-engineered, to a degree. Jarrod's book will give you a huge head-start in both. —Jarkko Laine, @jarkko</p>

	<!-- FAQ section -->
	<section class="faq">
		<h2>Why should you become the designer?</h2>
		<p>Because designers are expensive and templates are created without any understanding of the problem they propose to solve. With basic knowledge, you can create a design that is more than good enough to launch a new business.</p>

		<h2>Who is this book for?</h2>
		<p>The book is written primarily for programmers, but founders of all backgrounds and skill sets will learn just as well. Those not familiar with coding might not recognize a couple of terms, but the core principles are accessible to everyone.</p>

		<h2>Does the book cover this or that specific design topic?</h2>
		<p>This book contains the minimum design fundamentals that bootstrappers must understand in order to launch a business. My intent is to emphasize design basics. You’ll notice some topics, even popular ones, are absent. This is not because such topics are unimportant but because they are neither suitable for beginners nor relevant to their bottom line.</p>

		<h2>Note about .ePub & .Mobi formats:</h2>
		<p>For better viewing of the graphics and illustrations, consider using the PDF version of this eBook. The .ePub and .Mobi formats provide limited control over graphics and typography, and thus are less ideal for a design book. I've made every effort to ensure they are readable and useful for quick reference.</p>

	<section class="about">
		<p>I’m a web designer and bootstrapper. I believe in bootstrappers and the businesses they are building, and I know design can help them succeed. I’ve completed work for such diverse clients as funded tech startups, financial companies, movie studios, and consumer brands working at agencies and as a freelancer. I write code. I prefer getting things done to just talking about it. I want to help your startup succeed with practical but effective design.</p>
